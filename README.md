## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on various flight characteristics, including **airport origin**, **route**, **time of day**, and **weather conditions**. The analysis involves data exploration, visualization, and model building, using **PySpark** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

## Importing Necessary Packages

### Setting Up PySpark Environment
To get started, we first need to import the necessary packages and set up the **PySpark environment** for distributed processing and large-scale data handling.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml import *
```

### PySpark ML Packages
For building machine learning models, we import **PySpark ML** libraries, which help in handling data transformations, feature engineering, and training models.

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor, GBTRegressor
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
```

## Data Summary and Descriptive Statistics
The dataset consists of historical flight data, with key features such as flight number, departure/arrival times, delays, weather conditions, and airports.

### Descriptive Statistics
A summary of the data reveals important metrics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and percentiles) for various features that help understand the distribution and trends in flight delays.

```python
flight_data.describe().show()
```

## Data Preparation
Before modeling, the data is preprocessed by cleaning and transforming the features into a format suitable for machine learning.

### Sampling Data
We sample the dataset for **Random Forest Regression (RF)** and other models to ensure that the data is representative.

```python
sampled_data = flight_data.sample(fraction=0.1, seed=42)
```

## Modeling

### Random Forest Regressor (RF)
We train a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the delay time based on flight characteristics. The model is evaluated using metrics such as **R-squared** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

```python
rf = RandomForestRegressor(featuresCol="features", labelCol="delay")
rf_model = rf.fit(training_data)
```

### Logistic Regression
We also use **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a flight is delayed or not, based on certain features.

```python
log_reg = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="delay")
log_reg_model = log_reg.fit(training_data)
```

### Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBT)
Next, we apply a **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBT)** for regression tasks, predicting flight delays using boosting techniques.

```python
gbt = GBTRegressor(featuresCol="features", labelCol="delay")
gbt_model = gbt.fit(training_data)
```

## Model Evaluation and Comparison
We compare the performance of each model using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **R-squared**, and **RMSE** to determine the best-performing model.

### Traditional Logistic Regression vs. GBT
We will also compare **Logistic Regression** and **GBT** using **traditional methods** and summarize the time taken by each model.
